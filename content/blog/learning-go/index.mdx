Hello! My goals of this blog is to jot down my learning journey. I hope my blog posts can be helpful for someone who is trying to achieve something similar.

As I really don't know how this would end up being, I intend to grow this by looking at analytics and kinda evolve this as I go along.

I made sure I got syntax highlighting done nicely:

```jsx
import * as React from 'react'

const MyApp = () => {
  const [name, setName] = React.setState('KahWee')
  return (
    <div>
      {name}
    </div>
  )
}
```

So let's move forward.
